# Fantasy-Premier-League-SQL-Project

Importing a CSV file into psql is an important procedure that allows the user to extract meaningful insights from spreadsheets. Although excel has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and is more user-friendly, it fails to handle large CSV files and big data. This is where SQL comes in handy with its ability to handle large files. 

This report will explore how to load a CSV file into psql in command line, to perform queries and subqueries on the data, and to export the results of a query (a table) into a new CSV file. The chosen CSV file is a fantasy football player dataset for the 2021/2022 Barclays Premier League season. It contains player statistics such as goals, assists, creativity, and others. The aim of this report will be to extract meaningful insights from the data using queries and subqueries to discover the players with the best value for money.
